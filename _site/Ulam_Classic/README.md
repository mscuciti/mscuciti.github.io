# Ulam Spiral Playground

I've always been interested in the Ulam Spiral.
Which is famous for creating illustrations of prime-generating polynomials.

Primes are unique due to the fact that they only have trivial prime factors.
So what if we made an Ulam Spiral that showed semi-primes instead (2 non-trivial prime factors)?

That's what the code produces in HTML canvas.

The Ulam prime spiral shows lots of lines, which are interesting to look at.
I find it interesting that semi-primes show very little of such regularity.

If you find this code interesting, you can modify it easily enough.
For instance, I like to use the number of factors as a weight for color lightness.
Which shows a lot more lines than the regular spiral does.

There are probably a lot more illustrations that we can come up with using this approach.
If you find a new cool one, please share it with me!
