    <p>Hi I’m Matt, here are some projects I’ve been working on.</p>

<h2 id="ulam-spiral-classic"><a href="Ulam_Classic/index.html">Ulam Spiral (Classic)</a></h2>

<p>The classic Ulam Spiral, conveniently generated with canvas pixel manipulation.</p>

<h2 id="ulam-spiral-modified"><a href="Ulam/index.html">Ulam Spiral (Modified)</a></h2>

<p>Ever wonder what the Ulam spiral looks like when, instead of coloring each pixel as a boolean (black if prime, white if not), coloring based on number of prime factors? Wonder no more!</p>

<h2 id="more-ulam-spiraling"><a href="Ulam2/index.html">More Ulam Spiraling</a></h2>

<p>Here we color each pixel based on aliquot sum, whether the sum is less than or equal to n, and adjust the lightness based on the difference between n and the aliquot sum. I think it’s cool.</p>

<h2 id="game-engine-using-html5-divs"><a href="Game/index.html">Game Engine using HTML5 divs</a></h2>

<p>Primarily based on an <a href="http://buildnewgames.com/dom-sprites/">article</a> by <a href="https://x.com/McFunkypants/">Christer Kaitila</a> at <a href="http://buildnewgames.com/">Build New Games</a>, which was a blog active around 2012 which explored the possiblity of making games using pure HTML5 and JS.</p>

<p>Also influential in the creation of this engine was <a href="http://buildnewgames.com/js-game-code-org/">this article</a> by <a href="https://incompl.com/">Greg Smith</a> who created a bunch of cool games. I’m a huge fan of Greg’s ascii-based adventure game <a href="https://startcontinue.com/">91</a>. You should check it out!</p>
