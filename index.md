Here is some projects

## [Ulam Spiral](Ulam/index.html)

Ever wonder what the Ulam spiral looks like when, instead of coloring each pixel as a boolean (black if prime, white if not), coloring based on number of prime factors? Wonder no more!

There's other cool stuff you can do with this, like color based on aliquoit sum, color only semi-primes, etc. I plan on providing these as options in the future.

## [Game Engine using HTML5 divs](Game/index.html)

Primarily based on an [article](http://buildnewgames.com/dom-sprites/) by [Christer Kaitila](https://x.com/McFunkypants/) at [Build New Games](http://buildnewgames.com/), which was a blog active around 2012 which explored the possiblity of making games using pure HTML5 and JS.

Also influential in the creation of this engine was [this article](http://buildnewgames.com/js-game-code-org/) by [Greg Smith](https://incompl.com/) who created a bunch of cool games. I'm a huge fan of Greg's ascii-based adventure game [91](https://startcontinue.com/). You should check it out!
