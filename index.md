'Ere is a repository of uninteresting projects

## [Ulam Spiral](Ulam/index.html)

I made this a while ago because i get interested in the Ulam Spiral.

I thought it might reveal some more patterns to color pixels by number of prime factors.
That worked, but the link will take you to a canvas which simply colors the semiprimes.
Because I think that's cooler. 

## Other projects

More to come once i get around to converting my old codesandbox projects.
