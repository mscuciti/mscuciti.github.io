Hi I'm Matt, here are some projects I've been working on.

## [Ulam Spiral (Classic)](Ulam_Classic/index.html)

The classic Ulam Spiral, conveniently generated with canvas pixel manipulation.

## [Ulam Spiral (Modified)](Ulam/index.html)

Ever wonder what the Ulam spiral looks like when, instead of coloring each pixel as a boolean (black if prime, white if not), coloring based on number of prime factors? Wonder no more!

## [More Ulam Spiraling](Ulam2/index.html)

Here we color each pixel based on aliquot sum, whether the sum is less than or equal to n, and adjust the lightness based on the difference between n and the aliquot sum. I think it's cool.

## [Game Engine using HTML5 divs](Game/index.html)

Primarily based on an [article](http://buildnewgames.com/dom-sprites/) by [Christer Kaitila](https://x.com/McFunkypants/) at [Build New Games](http://buildnewgames.com/), which was a blog active around 2012 which explored the possiblity of making games using pure HTML5 and JS.

Also influential in the creation of this engine was [this article](http://buildnewgames.com/js-game-code-org/) by [Greg Smith](https://incompl.com/) who created a bunch of cool games. I'm a huge fan of Greg's ascii-based adventure game [91](https://startcontinue.com/). You should check it out!
